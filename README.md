# loanStatusPrediction
This project focuses on predicting the loan status of applicants using Logistic Regression and Decision Trees. Since the dataset was imbalanced, SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique) was applied to balance the classes. The primary goal is to identify significant factors and evaluate the performance of classification models.
